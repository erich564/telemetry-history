This is a coding exercise for a prospective employer. Note that performance was not optimized during development, since the code shall not be assessed that way (as per the instructions).

In order to run this solution, you'll need to read and perform some of the instructions in "Open MCT Coding exercise.pdf".

1) Per the PDF, you'll need to modify 'server.js' to insert the CORS blurb above the other "app.use()" statements in "server.js".
2) Per the PDF, host the example server.
3) Host my solution on port 8081. For example, using Python: "py -m http.server 8081"
4) Navigate to http://localhost:8081/
